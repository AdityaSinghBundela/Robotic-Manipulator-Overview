## Confidentiality & IP Notice

This repository presents a **high-level, non-proprietary overview** of robotic manipulators developed in an industrial setting.  
Specific dimensions, tolerances, supplier details, costs, control algorithms, and internal test data have been intentionally **abstracted or omitted** to comply with company confidentiality and intellectual property policies.

The focus is on **engineering intent, system-level architecture, and design trade-offs**, not proprietary implementation details.

## My Role & Ownership

**Role:** Mechanical Engineer (Intern → Full-Time)  
**Duration:** January 2024 – Present  
**Company:** Twara Robotics  
**Team Size:** Small cross-functional team (<5)

### End-to-End Ownership (Lead Role)
- **First-principles calculations:** kinematics, torque sizing, stiffness and workspace analysis  
- **System architecture & detailed mechanical design** of industrial robotic manipulators  
- **Manufacturing execution:** vendor coordination across CNC, sheet metal, laser cutting, and EDM  
- **Assembly & testing:** complete system build, payload testing, repeatability validation  
- **Design iteration:** closed-loop feedback from testing → redesign → production  
- **Jigs & fixtures design** to improve CAD-to-hardware accuracy and repeatability  

This was **lead ownership**, not support or documentation-only work.

- **Manufacturing lead time reduction**
  - First prototype: ~3 months  
  - TR5_G2: ~90 days  
  - Current production (TR5_G3): **~3 weeks**
- **~27% system weight reduction** while improving rigidity  
- **~30% manufacturing cost reduction** via DFMA and process optimization  
- Transitioned from intern to full-time engineer based on **direct product impact**

## Design Evolution (One-Glance Summary)

Generation 1: Prove performance → rigidity-first, CNC-heavy
Generation 2: Reduce cost & weight → sheet-metal focused
Generation 3: Scale reliably → balanced stiffness, modularity, fast manufacturing

## Representative Engineering Challenges

### Rigidity vs Weight
- Sheet-metal designs reduced mass but degraded stiffness  
- Re-architected structure and joints to recover repeatability  
- Result: Industrial-grade performance with controlled weight increase  

### Manufacturing Scalability
- CNC-heavy designs limited speed and cost targets  
- Shifted architecture toward sheet metal and modular joints  
- Result: Lead time reduced from months to **~3 weeks**

### Build Accuracy & Repeatability
- Early builds showed deviation from CAD intent  
- Designed improved **assembly jigs and fixtures**  
- Result: Significantly improved CAD-to-hardware accuracy and repeatability  

---

## Engineering Approach

- First-principles driven design (no black-box sizing tools)
- Quantitative trade-offs across **payload, reach, stiffness, and cost**
- Iterative loop: **analyze → design → build → test → refine**
- Toolchain evolution: hand calculations → spreadsheets → scripted analysis
- Precision actuation using **harmonic reducers**

---

## Manufacturing, Assembly & Validation

- Direct coordination with multiple fabrication vendors  
- Fabrication-ready drawings, GD&T, and DFMA reviews  
- Full mechanical assembly and system integration  
- Payload, repeatability, and validation testing  
- Field deployment support and feedback-driven improvements
